    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The clown emporium had just closed up for the night. The janitor with his rainbow-colored polyester wig and big red nose was making his rounds when he encountered something unusual...</p>
    <p>Most nights, Janitor Wiggins expected to be cleaning up the typical batches of limbs and childhood nightmares, but nothing could have prepared him for the ghastly site that lay spread before him - almost as if it had been designed just for him. Eyes darting from one end to the other, Wiggins felt a scream building in his throat that no amount of bravery could stifle. Who would do such a thing? Why now? Why him? What could he possibly have done to earn such horrors?</p>
    <p>He opened his mouth and began to scream.</p>
    <p>There stood an angry mother. Her brow frowed in extreme distain. Her mouth agape and dark as the abyss. Her screaming as piercing as a knife. Her words cut him like a cleaver. He began to run and the angry mother gave chase. But he tripped over his floppy, oversized shoes. He cursed his chosen profession as the mother decended upon him. He could only imagine the horrors that may come down upon him.</p>
    <p>"DON'T RUN SO FAST!" she shrieked, throwing herself on top of his prone (and now bruised) body. "You've got a smudge here, just let me get that..." Wiggins' terrified squirming did nothing to dislodge the insistent mother as she straddled his chest and licked her thumb.</p>
    <p>"OH DEAR GOD NO!" In a state of complete panic, Wiggins had no idea how to avoid what he knew to be the next step in this twisted, sadistic bitch's plan. With almost cinematic sloth, this irate mother brought her spit-coated thumb down to Wiggins' cheek, pressed it roughly into his flesh, and scrubbed hard enough to crush his sinus cavity.</p>
    <p>Throat hoarse from screaming, Wiggins could do nothing to halt the tears forming rivers down his freshly adulterated face.</p>
    <p>The mother smiled down at him, her wickedness burning from her every pore.</p>
    <p>"Oh dear. It looks like your hair may need fixing too, young man."</p>
    <p>She pulled out of her purse, a pair of rusty scissors, coated in fresh blood. "No. No no no no. Please! Spare me!" The clown pleads for his life but the mother is not listening. She opens the scissors. They squeak and moan. She presses a cutting edge to the clown's scalp. He begins to bleed. She continues to liberate his scalp as screams in excruciating pain. The mother completes her dark task and stands, stashes her trophy into her purse. The clown lay on the freshly mopped floor, bleeding out as he streches his out his hand toward this evil woman. He utters his final words "I should have been a construction worker..."</p>
