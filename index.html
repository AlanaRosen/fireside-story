    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The clown emporium had just closed up for the night. The janitor with his rainbow-colored polyester wig and big red nose was making his rounds when he encountered something unusual...</p>
    <p>Most nights, Janitor Wiggins expected to be cleaning up the typical batches of limbs and childhood nightmares, but nothing could have prepared him for the ghastly site that lay spread before him - almost as if it had been designed just for him. Eyes darting from one end to the other, Wiggins felt a scream building in his throat that no amount of bravery could stifle. Who would do such a thing? Why now? Why him? What could he possibly have done to earn such horrors?</p>
